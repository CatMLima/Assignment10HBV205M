A sample project with JUnit 5.8 showcasing JUnit5 testing, including native test suites. 

This project is a Maven project that can be cloned via `git clone` and at the same time also an Eclipse project. 

Import to Eclipse via: 

1. File 
1. Import 
1. Git
1. Projects from Git *(Note: do __not__ use "with smart import")* 
1. Next
1. *Select* Clone URI
1. *paste Clone URI as* URI
1. Next *(i.e.* import `main` branch *)*
1. Next *(to confirm your local directory location to clone to)*
1. Next *(to confirm* Import existing Eclipse projects *)*
1. Finish

This should have given you a new project: `junit5demoWithMaven`

(Note: Eclipse did not check out the root directory with `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, only the directory `junit5demoWithMaven` containing the actual Eclipse project).
